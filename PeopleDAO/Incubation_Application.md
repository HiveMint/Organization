# HiveMint Incubation Application for PeopleDAO

## 1) What is your project name?

- HiveMint founded by Y4000

## 2) Are you applying for incubation as a PeopleDAO community project or a subDAO?

- community project

## 3) Please give a brief summary of your proposal.

- A turnkey solution for creating an NFT Mint Drop dApp website.  Creating an NFT collection has so many moving parts. Instead of starting from scratch for each project, this solution bundles the common elements and best practices so that planning and rolling out a large NFT collection is streamlined and straightforward. HiveMint enables project creators to focus on the art and marketing strategy for their project.
- Our tool makes it easy for projects to fundraise for non-profits and DAOs.  The goal is to host a directory of non-profit organizations and DAOs open to collaboration with NFT projects.  Each one of these orgs will have an associated vetted wallet.  NFT projects can link up with any organization and agree to allocate some percentage of their mint fundraising towards the organization.  In turn the organizations can help highlight the NFT projects.  The HiveMint deployable smart contract will bake the fundraising split directly into the final NFT contract.

## 4) Identify the relevant need in web3, problem web3 you're positioned to solve, or market gap.

- NFTs are an established form of fundraising and written about in Kevin Owocki's [Greenpilled]([url](https://greenpill.party/#book)).  Collectors buy NFTs seeking utility and collectability.  Creators looking to launch an NFT project and provide utility need easier tooling so they can launch projects cheaply and quickly.  Collectors will appreciate using a streamlined and standardized platform and find comfort in knowing HiveMint's contracts are audited. 

## 5) Provide a description of your project and how it solves the above need/problem/gap.

- Break common needs into reusable components that can be configured via a simple to use admin interface
- Flexible mint component which can take any ABI and allow configuration for common mint options. Initial version built to the HiveMint contract template.  Projects wishing to deploy custom smart contracts will require an audit fee and be handled on a case-by-case basis.
- If consumers are tuned into a “safe place to mint” new projects — there will be less hesitation with diving into new NFT drops.
- A marketplace directory allowing NFT projects and Non-profits/DAOs to link up to collaborate on shared goals.

## 6) Please provide information about your professional experience and skills (include any relevant links to social media, portfolio or previous projects, Github, POAP collection, Linkedin, etc).

- Qualifications for founder, Y4000: Entrepreneur, Product Developer, Generative Artist.  First contribution to the PeopleDAO Community: the CFRAC NFT project, which included the generative art work, the NFT smart contract on Ethereum mainnet, and the minting web application.  

## 7) How will the project build around the $PEOPLE token or contribute to the PeopleDAO ecosystem?

- HiveMint is running the beta in collaboration with the PeopleDAO.  HiveMint is the pre-mint allowlist building platform as well as the minting dApp for NFT projects coming out of PeopleDAO including: *Journey Owaa*, *For The People*, and *Afro Piece*.  
- PeopleDAO-related NFT projects will benefit from the early access of the HiveMint platform and have direct influence on the future of the HiveMint product development.  
- Going forward PeopleDAO will be grandfathered into using future offerings of the HiveMint platform at a free or discounted rate when compared to what HiveMint may advertise to outside consumers.

## 8) What kind of Return on Investment will this project bring the DAO?

- PeopleDAO will benefit from having access to the HiveMint platform to streamline their future NFT drops.
- HiveMint plans to offer an "Insights NFT Pass" to raise the initial significant seed round of financing.  Some percentage of this raise will be allocated for the PeopleDAO Treasury as well as some number of passes.

## 9) What are indicators of how we will measure the project’s success?

- We will interview the founders of *Journey Owaa*, *For The People*, and *The Afro Piece* and evaluate satisfaction with the HiveMint product.
- How the product learns and evolves with each of these NFT launches. We will get feedback on HiveMint interations during Fireside Chat meetings.
- How the "go to market" is received and the number of outside projects using HiveMint within the first year.

## 10) Please give a brief roadmap.

- Phase 1: (9/22) Reusable premint allowlist building and NFT Minting dApp site for projects
- Phase 1a: (9/22) Google Form to start gathering DAOs and Non-Profits who would like to be a part of our marketplace.
- Phase 2: (11/22) Self-service management tools for projects to sign on and launch their premint and minting sites
- Phase 3: (01/23) Flesh out email marketing for project community communication, once a project has minted-out, the system can target ACTUAL NFT holders with messaging.  For new wallets who've acquired the NFTs, they can register for communication.  For wallets who've sold their NFTs, they'll fall out of the loop of the communication.
- Phase 4: (02/23) Build out the marketplace of DAOs and Non-Profits open to collaboration with new NFT projects.

## 11) What’s the amount of seed funding you’re requesting? Include a high-level summary of what the funding will be used for. Skip this question if you only want in-kind resources (addressed in the next question). 

- 200,000 $PEOPLE.  Cold start budget for marketing and product development expenses.  
- 100% of the cold start budget is towards external expenses, none is intended as a personal allocation for Y4000.
- Breakdown:

| Allocation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 50% | Marketing | 
| 25% | Design | 
| 25% | Development |

- Allocation to design and development is lower because most of the design and development is done by Y4000.  

## 12) What in-kind resources do you need? For example, staffing, product development, strategic development, marketing, or dev work. 

- Marketing
- Smart Contract Auditing
- Software/Product testing and feedback.  
- Copywriting
- General strategic advice/feedback around product and marketing.
